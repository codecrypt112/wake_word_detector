THIS IS FOR MY THESIS OR RESEARCH PAPER. THIS WILL BE DONE FROM SCRATCH WITH THE HELP OF CHATGPT

AIM: 
    -> create a wake word dector that listens to only your voice. 

IDK about it, or I have any experiecnce in audio processing, but imma give it a try.

CHECK LIST:
TODO:

1. Collect and Prepare Data: Gather audio samples containing the wake word "j" and non-"j" audio samples for training. -- DONE

2. Preprocess Data: Preprocess the audio data to a format suitable for input into a neural network. -- DONE

3. Build the Model: Construct a neural network architecture for wake word detection using TensorFlow. --DONE

4. Train the Model: Train the model using the prepared data. -- SKIPPING FOR NOW. 

5. Real-time Detection: Implement a real-time audio stream processing pipeline to detect the wake word.
